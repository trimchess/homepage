If a project contains more than one game, the links on this site can be used to operate so, that a selected game comes up at first (only if frames are used).<br> Also, you can link to a selected position of a game by writing &lt;&gt; as comments after the corresponding move.After converting, additional links for the marked moves will appear on this page. The characters &lt;&gt; must be written at the start of the move comment, and they will be removed in the created game page.
